### [Automated Pull Scripts](Automated%20Pull%20Scripts/)

The [Automated Pull Scripts](Automated%20Pull%20Scripts/) folder contains scripts that allow learners to clone specific folders from the repository using sparse checkout. Each stream has its own set of scripts for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

#### Folders and Scripts:

- **SE**: Contains the sparse checkout scripts for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  - Files: `SE_repo_clone_MacOS`, `SE_repo_clone_Windows`, `SE_repo_clone_Linux`

### Using the Scripts

Learners should start by using the appropriate script for their stream and operating system. Below is a table linking directly to each script. To get started with the Lecture Backpack, follow these steps:

1. **Install Git**: Before you begin, ensure that Git is installed on your local machine. You can find detailed installation instructions in the internal documentation located at [`StarterPack/Git/README.md`](StarterPack/Git/README.md).

2. **Choose and Download an Automated Pull Script**: Depending on your chosen stream (Software Engineering) and your operating system, download the appropriate Automated Pull Script provided in the repository.

   - **Download the script**:
     - **Right-click on the script link** below for your stream and operating system.
     - **Select "Save Link As..." or "Save Target As..."** to download the script to your machine.
   - **Execute the script**: After downloading, execute the script on your machine. This will clone the repository and pull only the relevant files for your learning path.
